# Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm

One of my responsibilities as a tutor for the Gravitational Waves Astrophysics masters course was to lead the students in a journal club discussion of some key academic papers, of which my favourite by far was the original FFT paper: An Algorithm for the Machine Calculation of Complex Fourier Series by James W. Cooley and John W. Tukey. In order to fully understand the contents of the paper before discussing it with my students, I implemented the FFT algorithm in python, as presented here in this project.

This repository simply contains my notebook with the basic FFT implementation, a couple tests and a demonstration of spectral analysis.
